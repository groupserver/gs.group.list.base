Richard,

After sending his first PAS/PCE 2 Announcement email, Philip received 
four emails similar to the one below.

Can you tell me what this means, please.

Dan

TO ALL 2007 PAS/PCE 2 CANDIDATES

Below is the first PAS Newsletter for candidates enrolled on the 2007
PAS/PCE 2 Programme.

As you work through the programme over the coming months, you will
receive a number of PAS Newsletters from ABEL.=20

PLEASE NOTE that you cannot use the Newsletter email address to contact
either ABEL or other PAS candidates. If you have any queries about the
programme or about your use of the ABEL eCampus, please go to the 'Help'
section of the ABEL eCampus and follow the steps outlined there.=20

PAS NEWSLETTER NO.1

-The ABEL eCampus
-Your eWorkshop Group
-Introductory Exercise
-Programme Fee

Welcome to the 2007 PAS/PCE 2 Programme. ABEL hopes that you will find
this year's programme both stimulating and challenging.=20

THE ABEL eCAMPUS

The ABEL eCampus is a virtual campus designed to support you during the
PAS/PCE 2 Programme. You will participate in the eCampus via email and
the Web. The eCampus INTEGRATES the PAS/PCE 2 Programme website with
group email access, initially for all the members of your workshop group
(see below), and then later during the programme, for other work
groups/teams that are formed.

You should by now have completed Step 1 of the eCampus Introductory
Exercise to ensure that you are aware of the main features of the
eCampus.

YOUR eWORKSHOP GROUP

You are now a member of an eWorkshop Group for the 2007 PAS Programme.
In this online group, you will meet up to 24 other PAS/PCE 2 candidates
with whom you will be collaborating, both online and at the six
face-to-face PAS workshop meetings during the year.

Your two Workshop Facilitators for the first three workshops will join
your eWorkshop shortly before the Easter break in early April. Senior
ABEL staff have access to your eWorkshop Group, but will not participate
actively in them.

INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE

Please revisit the eCampus and work through the online activities
outlined in Step 2 of the Introductory Exercise.=20

It is important that you complete the activities in Step 2 BEFORE you
receive your couriered copy of your study material (for the first half
of the programme) in the week beginning 12 March. These activities will
introduce you more fully to the eCampus, to online collaboration and to
the other candidates in your Workshop Group. They will also be relevant
as you work through an exercise in your first Professional Skills Study
Plan, which will then later lead to an activity in Workshop 1.

PROGRAMME FEE

To ensure that you get your PAS study material couriered to you on time,
it is important that you pay the balance of your PAS/PCE 2 Programme fee
by the due date of 5 March 2007. Payment after this date will cause a
delay in your study material reaching you.
