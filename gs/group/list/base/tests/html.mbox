Good evening.<BR>
<BR>
On Ethel the Frog tonight we look at violence: the violence of British Gangland. Last Tuesday a reign of terror was ended when the notorious<BR>
Piranha Brothers, Dug and Dinsdale &#8213; after one the of most extraordinary trials in British legal history &#8213; were sentenced to 400 years imprisonment for crimes of violence.<BR>
<BR>
Tonight Ethel the Frog examines the rise to power of the Piranha Brothers&#8230;<BR>
